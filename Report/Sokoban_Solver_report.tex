\section{Solver}
% Briefly discuss how A* search algorithm has been implemented in order to solve the problem 
\subsection{State Representation}
% Used a class to represent the state representation
% Container for both two properties worker and boxes both of which were tuples in the form ((x,y) 
% Overrode methods such to make sate representation hashable to allow it to be stored in a the frontier set
% Overrode less than method to allow it co be compared in the best first search

\subsection{Heuristic}
% Explain what the heuristic is calculating and how it is valid for the problem
% Prove that it is admissible
% Potentially prove that it is consistent otherwise demonstrate its consistent by discussing test of consistency
% Potentially include illustration demonstrating what its calculating compared to actual cost
\subsection{Other Classes and Methods}
% Brief outline how puzzle class interacts with search class and utilizes taboo cells 
\subsubsection{Taboo Cells}
% Explain taboo cells function:
    % Modified Breadth first search algorithm to determine interior cells
    % is_corner method applied to all interior cells using transforms to calculate adjacent cells and thus determine corners
    % Edges were found from corners and checked if entire edge was along a wall using check_edge 
    % Corners and edges made taboo cells
% Potentially add diagram explaining what taboo cells are 
\subsubsection{SokobanPuzzle}
% Explain SokobanPuzzle class:
    % Discuss initial parameters noting that taboo_cells is an optional parameter
    % Discuss functions: (Uses method docstring maybe touch on implementation )
        % result
        % actions
        % goal_test
        % path_cost
        % box_movable mention how it checks taboo cells if they exist

\section{Testing}
% Discuss how each tests was preformed on all major methods to validate their output
% Mention they we based off tests found in sanity_check
% Discuss how solver tests checked timings and checked against provided solutions in the FAQ
% Method how we used a mixture of black box and white box testing
    % I.E Some tests were done prior to completing methods additional tests added after completion
% Might add addition tests
% Potentially add table showing what was tested and too what degree 

\section{Performance and Limitations}
% Discuss what problems it can complete and how long it takes
% Generalized explaining what sort of problems it preforms quickly on and which ones it does not
% Mention for example how it takes a long time to confirm warehouse 5n is impossible
% Discuss why some examples seem to be significantly slower then the ones found in the FAQ
    % Reasons for this most likely due to using a class for the state representation as opposed to a tuple of tuples
    % Mention that class instantiation and deconstruction takes additional time as it must instantiate the class object and its nested classes, in the form of the worker and box tuples
    % Not maybe that this does make the code look cleaner and more readable
% Use table too display times for each problem
